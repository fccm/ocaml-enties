CONCLUSIONS

Moving from blob style object hierarchies to composite objects made from a
collection of components was one of the best decisions I made. The initial
results were disappointing as it took a long time to re-factor existing code.
However, the end results were well worth it, with lightweight, flexible, robust
and re-usable code.
