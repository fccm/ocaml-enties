This small demo is a minimalistic "equivalent" of the game
named "Chain Reaction": http://www.yvoschaap.com/chainrxn/
This demo was made to try, test and feel the entity/component
concept in OCaml.

The windowing can be made through SDL, ClanLib or SFML (use
the respective run_*.sh scripts, and run 'make clean' before
to switch from one to another).
